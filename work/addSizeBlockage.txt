Name
       addSizeBlockage - Adds a size blockage object that controls the behavior of the resize line under a
       covered area

Syntax
       addSizeBlockage [-help] [-name <blockageName>] [-isResizeable] -box <x1 y1 x2 y2>

Description
       Adds a size blockage object that controls the behavior of the resize line under a covered area. The
       object  area prevents floorplan objects in this area from being resized and maintains the alignment
       and minimum space between these objects during floorplan resize. Size blockage is special  kind  of
       blockage  that  is  only  honored by the resizeFloorplan command. By default resize line can not go
       through size blockage, which means, objects under size blockage stay fixed after floorplan  resize.
       You can use this command before using the resizeFloorplan command.


Parameters
       -box <x1 y1 x2 y2>
              Specifies  the  lower  left x coordinate, lower left y coordinate, upper right x coordinate,
              and upper right y coordinate respectively of the size blockage area.

              Data_type: box, required

       -help  Outputs a brief description that includes type and default  information  for  each  addSize-
              Blockage parameter. For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use
              the man command:

              man addSizeBlockage

       -isResizeable
              Specifies that the size blockage can be resized, however alignment  and  the  minimum  space
              between  the  objects  in the blockage area will be maintained during floorplan resize. When
              this options is specified, the resize line can go through size blockage. But it can not turn
              direction  inside  blockage.  The  benefit  of using this option is if objects (for example,
              macros) under size blockage are aligned  before  calling  resizeFloorplan,  they  will  stay
              aligned after the command.

              Data_type: bool, optional

       -name <blockageName>
              Specifies the name of the size blockage.

              Data_type: string, optional


Example
       The following command creates a size blockage.

       addSizeBlockage -name sizeBlkg1 -box 400 400 500 500
