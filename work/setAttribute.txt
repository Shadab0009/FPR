Description
       Attaches  attributes  to nets and subnets. Attaching the attributes allows the NanoRoute routing commands
       (globalRoute, detailRoute, globalDetailRoute, routeDesign, and setNanoRouteMode),  and  the  earlyGlobal-
       RouteearlyGlobalRoute  command  to route the nets following specific requirements. Attributes are persis-
       tent; that is, throughout the routing process, from global routing to optimization, the routers honor the
       attributes.  The  attributes are saved in the Innovus System database. If you save the database and exit,
       the attributes remain attached to the nets when you re import the database.

       Note:  Attributes are not saved in the DEF file.

       To see the current attribute settings, use the getAttribute command. If you attempt  to  run  the  setAt-
       tribute  command  on any net that is part of a diffPair, matchLength, or complex shield constraint group,
       or a simple or complex netClass, the command reports an error stating that the command cannot be  run  on
       nets with integration constraints.

       Tip: To revert to the default value of an attribute, specify default for the attribute.


Parameters
       -avoid_detour {true | false}
              Avoids  detours  of  roughly  more  than  a  few gcell grids on the specified nets. This attribute
              affects global routing only.

              Note: Cadence recommends that you use caution with this attribute, as it adds  congestion  to  the
              design.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -bottom_preferred_routing_layer <layer_number>
              Specifies  the  preferred lowest routing layer. This attribute is a soft limit; that is, NanoRoute
              might use a layer below the specified layer if necessary to complete routing.

              Range: 0-15

              Note: Layers can only be specified using their layer ID numbers. Use of LEF  layer  names  is  not
              supported by this parameter.

              Note:   If  the  top  routing  layer is equal to or greater than 4 and no bottom preferred routing
              layer is specified for clock nets, the router automatically  sets  the  bottom  preferred  routing
              layer for clock nets to 3, to prevent the clock nets from blocking other nets.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -bottom_preferred_shielding_layer <layer_number>
              Specifies the preferred lowest shielding layer.

              Note:  Layers  can  only  be specified using their layer ID numbers. Use of LEF layer names is not
              supported by this parameter.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -cell_pin <cell_name>:<pin_name>
              Specifies attributes for all the nets connected to pins of instances having the same master cells.
              You can use: or / as a delimiter when you specify the cell name and the corresponding pin name.

              Note:   If  the  specified  setAttribute commands conflict, then the last setting takes precedence
              over all the previous setAttribute settings.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -coaxial_shield_interval tracks_number | metal_layer_name:tracks_number ...
              Specifies the interval of crossties by routing track.

              Range: 0-63

              Default: 0. Every track could be used by crosstie.

              For example, when -coaxial_shield_interval 2 is specified, two tracks between two  crossties  will
              be empty.

              Data_type: string, optional


       -coaxial_shield_limit <layer_number:layer_number>
              Specifies the bottom and top routing layer limits for coaxial shields.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -coaxial_shielded_layers <layer_number>:<layer_number>
              Specifies the bottom and top routing layer for coaxial shields.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -comp_pin <comp>:<pin_name> <list>
              Specifies attributes for all nets and sub-nets connected to pins of instances having the same com-
              ponent. You can specify a list of pins. You can use  :  or / as a delimiter when you  specify  the
              component names and the corresponding pin names.

              Data_type: string, optional


       -em_ndr_dist <double>
              Specifies the distance from source to sink where it is needed to be applied with the EM ndr rule

              Default: 0

              Data_type: string, optional


       -em_ndr_rule <ruleName>
              Specifies the non-default rule name which is used for EM issue fixing.

              Default: " " empty

              Data_type: string, optional


       -em_width_rule <layer width:dist pairs>
              Specifies  the table of layer width:distance pairs. The layer width pair denotes the width for any
              layer to be changed from default width for EM fixing in distance X from driver.

              For example, Metal1 1.0:0.5, Metal2 2.0:1.0

              Note: The -em_width_rule parameter must be used with the -em_ndr_dist parameter.  It  can  not  be
              used  with  the  -em_ndr_rule parameter as only one parameter can specify the non default width to
              apply.

              Data_type: string, optional


       -help  Outputs a brief description that includes the type and default information for  each  setAttribute
              parameter.For  a  detailed  description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man com-
              mand:

               man setAttribute.


       -inst_pin  <instance:pin_name><list>
              Specifies attributes for all nets and sub-nets connected to pins of the  same  instance.  You  can
              specify a list of pins. You can use  :  or / as a delimiter when you specify the pin names and the
              corresponding instance names.

              Data_type: string, optional


       -layer_mask <bottomLayerNum:topLayerNum>
              Specifies the layer range to which the mask constraint should be  applied.  For  example,  if  you
              specify 3:4, it means that the constraint should be applied on layers, Metal3 and Metal4.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -mask <mask_number>
              Masks constraint setting for the net. Legal values are from 0 to the mask number for the layers. A
              value of 0 indicates that there is no mask constraint on the net. A non-zero value indicates  that
              all  wiring  on  the  net  should be created on the specified mask. Layers that do not support the
              specified value will be treated as unconstrained.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -max_fanout <integer>
              Specifies the maximum fanout value for nets and subnets.

              Specifying setAttribute -net <netname> -max_fanout <value> provides per net based max_fanout  con-
              straint/control for a net.

              *

                * If -max_fanout value of a net is 0, and the -pattern of the net is trunk, the NanoRoute router
                  honors the value of getNanoRouteMode -routeTrunkWithClusterTargetSize as the max fanout.

                * If -max_fanout value of a net is larger than 0, and the -pattern of  the  net  is  trunk,  the
                  -max_fanuout  value  overrides  the value of getNanoRouteMode -routeTrunkWithClusterTargetSize
                  for the net.



              Default: 0

              Data_type: string, optional


       -min_stack_layer <layer_number>
              Specifies the minimum stacking layer. It indicates that stacked vias should be added to the speci-
              fied  layer  on  output  pin  only.  If a pin already has pre-defined custom stacked vias, and the
              uppermost layer of the vias is still below the specified layer, additional stack  vias  should  be
              added  to  the  specified layer. Then, regular routing would start from the specified layer of the
              stacked vias.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -multi_cut_via_effort {low|medium|high}
              Specifies the multi-cut via effort. The effort level can be low, medium, or high.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -ndr_si_length_limit {<layer:distance>list}
              Specifies the table of parallel run length on each layer. For example, Metal1 1.0, Metal2 2.0.  It
              relaxes  a  hard  NDR into a soft NDR whenever the parallel run length between the NDR wire and an
              other wire is smaller than the specified value

              For example,

              setNanoRouteMode -routeStrictlyHonorNonDefaultRule true

              setAttribute -net {xgxs_tx_rdy_lane[1]} -ndr_si_length_limit {metal3:0.054}

              Where, xgxs_tx_rdy_lane[1] is the net name, metal3:0.054 is the prl limit 0.054 in Metal3 layer.

              This setting is for, if parallel run length is less than distance(0.054) in the layer(Metal3)  for
              the specified net, no NDR spacing is needed for this net (wire segment).

              Data_type: string, optional

       -net <netName>
              Specifies the net for which to set attributes. Do not enter more than one net name.

              * To specify more than one net, use * and ? wildcard characters.

              * To specify nondefault rule nets, use @RULE.

              * To specify clock nets, use @CLOCK. (To select clock nets use selectNet -allDefClock.)

              * To specify prerouted nets, use @PREROUTED.


              Note:  Remove  an attribute from a net by specifying none. For example, to remove the - shield_net
              attribute from net_1, specify the following command:

              setAttribute -net net_1 -shield_net none

              Data_type: string, optional

       -non_default_rule <rule_name>
              Identifies the nondefault routing rule to use with the specified net. Use this attribute for crit-
              ical  nets,  such  as  clock nets, that might need to have wider wires or wider spacing than other
              nets. The NanoRoute router treats nondefault rule spacing as a soft attribute; that is, when rout-
              ing  resources  are  available,  it  honors the nondefault rule. If the area is too congested, and
              resources are not available, the router might not honor nondefault spacing rules. You can override
              this  behavior  by  specifying  setNanoRouteMode  -routeStrictlyHonorNonDefaultRule true. When you
              specify this parameter, the router uses the nondefault spacing rules.

              You define nondefault routing rules in the NONDEFAULTRULE statement of the LEF file.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -non_default_rule_effort {auto|soft|hard|no_taper}
              Specifies the non-default rule effort to use with the specified net. You can set any  one  of  the
              options:

              * auto: follows the HARDSPACING for the NDR in the LEF file.

              * hard: makes the NDR hard even if HARDSPACING is not set in the LEF file.

              * soft: makes the NDR soft even if HARDSPACING is set in the LEF file.

              * no_taper: follows the HARDSPACING for the NDR in the LEF file and does not allow tapering at all
                pins.


              Default: auto

              Data_type: string, optional

       -one_side_spacing <bottomLayerNum:topLayerNum>
              Specifies the layer range that the one_side_spacing constraint should be  applied  on.  This  con-
              straint means that spacing is reserved on any one side. For example, 3:4 means that the constraint
              should be applied on layers, Metal3 and Metal4.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -pattern {steiner | trunk}
              Specifies the routing pattern. Select one of the following:

              * steiner: Routes all pins with a single steiner tree.

              * trunk: Routes pins to the nearest special net of the same name. Creates multiple  steiner  trees
                and connects them to the trunk.

              * Data_type: string, optional


       -preferred_extra_space  <integer>
              Specifies  the  preferred  extra spacing for nets. Gives additional pitch spacing to the specified
              net. Use this attribute to give critical nets  extra  space  to  reduce  coupling.  Specify  -pre-
              ferred_extra_space  1  to give a net 1 extra pitch spacing, compared to other nets. This parameter
              creates a soft rule and, if the design is congested, might not give the extra space to the net.

              Range: 0-3

              Note:  If you specify this attribute, Early Global Route also gives additional space to the speci-
              fied nets.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -preferred_routing_layer_effort {low | medium | high | hard}
              Determines  how  flexible  the NanoRoute router is when setting layer limits for routing specified
              nets. Use this attribute with the -top_preferred_routing_layer and -bottom_preferred_routing_layer
              attributes.  Specify  medium,  high,  or  hard  to  make NanoRoute less flexible (that is, to make
              NanoRoute obey the preferred routing layer range more strictly). When set to hard, NanoRoute  pre-
              vents the nets from going to the non-preferred routing layers by setting large costs.

              Default: low (more flexible)

              Data_type: string, optional

       -reset Currently  you cannot reset all the attributes of a net. You can reset each  attribute of a net by
              using the -reset parameter with the attribute or you can use the default keyword for the value  of
              each attribute.

              For example:

              * The  following  command  sets  the  weight  attribute  of  the net (scan_in_1) to 3 and the mask
                attribute to 2:

                setAttribute -net scan_in_1 -weight 3 -mask 2

              * The following command resets the weight attribute of the net:

                setAttribute -net scan_in_1 -reset -weight -mask 2

              * The following command resets the mask attribute of the net:

                setAttribute -net scan_in_1 -weight 3 -mask default


              Data_type: string, optional

       -shield_net <special_net_name>
              Specifies a special net to use as a shield for a critical or high-speed net. Typically, you  route
              shielded nets before routing other nets. You can specify one or two shield nets, however, you can-
              not control which side is used by the special net that is routed on the same layer as  the  signal
              routing. The shield terminates near the pin. Shielding information is saved in the DEF file.

              Note:   The  router  does not support shielding nets that are defined in the SPECIALNET section of
              the DEF file. This limitation extends to nets that are defined partly in  the  SPECIALNET  section
              and partly in the regular NET section of the file, such as some clock nets. If you set the shield-
              ing attribute on these nets, the router automatically sets the - skip_routing attribute on them as
              well.  As a result, the nets are not modified by the router and, if they are not completely routed
              already, the router does not try to finish the connections. The router does not delete the shield-
              ing wires.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -shield_side {one_side | two_sides}
              Specifies the number of sides to route shield.

              Default: two_sides

              Data_type: string, optional

       -si_post_route_fix {true | false}
              Repairs crosstalk violations on specified nets.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -skip_antenna_fix {true | false}
              Prevents  the  router from repairing violations on specified nets with process antenna violations.
              This attribute is useful on nets that will have antenna violations repaired at the next  level  of
              hierarchy.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -skip_routing {true | false}
              Prevents  the  NanoRoute  router from routing or rerouting unrouted or partially routed nets. When
              you specify -skip_routing for a net, the router treats the net as if you had marked it + FIXED  in
              the  DEF  file  and  it becomes an obstruction for other nets. If the net is partially routed, the
              router does not complete the routing.

              Note: The value you specify for this attribute also applies to Early Global Route.

              Note: To skip routing on prerouted nets, specify setAttribute

              Data_type: string, optional

       -stack_distance <distance>
              Specifies the stacking distance in microns.

              Default: 0

              Data_type: string, optional

       -stripe_layer_range <minLayer>:<maxLayer>
              Specifies the layer range that accommodates different StripeLayerRanges  for  different  nets  and
              subnets. You need to specify the following values with this parameter:

              * maxLayer: Specifies the top-most floating stripe layer allowed for connection.

              *

                minLayer: Specifies the bottom-most floating stripe layer allowed for connection


              For example, 3:4 means that the constraint should be applied on M3 and M4.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -sub_net <sub_net_name>
              Specifies the subnet for which to set attributes. This parameter is used with the -net parameter.

              For example:

              setAttribute -net <netName> -sub_net <sub_net_name>

              You  can specify multiple subnets using this parameter. Wildcards are supported for specifying the
              -comp_pin and -inst_pin parameters for subnets. You can remove this parameter  by  specifying  the
              -reset parameter.

              For example:

              setAttribute -net <netName> -sub_net <sub_net_name> -reset

              The following attributes can be set on subnets:

              -non_default_rule <rule_name>

              -bottom_preferred_routing_layer <layer_number>

              -top_preferred_routing_layer <layer_number>

              -preferred_routing_layer_effort {low | medium | high}

              -preferred_extra_space <integer>

              -pattern {steiner | trunk}

              -skip_routing {true | false}

       -top_preferred_routing_layer <layer_number>
              Specifies  the preferred highest layer for routing specified signal nets. This attribute is a soft
              limit; that is, NanoRoute might use a layer above the specified layer  if  necessary  to  complete
              routing.  Use  this  attribute  to  improve timing by restricting the routing layers available for
              critical nets, while simultaneously routing other nets on all routing layers.

              Range: 0-15

              Note: Layers can only be specified using their layer ID numbers. Use of LEF  layer  names  is  not
              supported by this parameter.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -top_preferred_shielding_layer <layer_number>
              Specifies the preferred highest shielding layer.

              Note:  Layers  can  only  be specified using their layer ID numbers. Use of LEF layer names is not
              supported by this parameter.

              Data_type: string, optional

       -weight <integer>
              Specifies a relative weight for routing nets. In each switch box, the NanoRoute router routes nets
              with  the  highest  weight  first, then the next highest weight, and so on. Specify a value higher
              than 2 to ensure a net is routed before other nets.

              Default: 2

              Note:  A switch box is a collection of global routing cells used during detailed routing. When you
              specify  a  net  weight and route a net, the router does not route the entire net according to the
              weight. It routes the nets in each switch box with the highest weight first, then the next highest
              weight, and so on.

Examples
              * The following command sets the net weight for net1 to 4:

                setAttribute -net net1 -weight 4

                Setting  the  weight to 4 forces the router to route net1 before it routes nets whose net weight
                is less than 4.

              * The following command sets the net weight for all nets whose net name starts with net1 to 4:

                setAttribute -net net1* -weight 4

              * The following command limits routing for net1 to layers Metal4 and Metal5 if possible:

                setAttribute -net net1 -top_preferred_routing_layer Metal5\

                -bottom_preferred_routing_layer Metal4

              * The following command adds two additional grid units around net1. The additional grid  units  do
                not have any routing.

                setAttribute -net net1 -preferred_extra_space 2

              * The following command uses the nondefault rule wide_wire1 for routing net1:

                setAttribute -net net1 -non_default_rule wide_wire1

              * The following command uses the default rule for routing net1.

                setAttribute -net net1 -non_default_rule default

              * The  following  commands  shield  net1  with both power and ground wires, and shield net2 with a
                ground wire:

                setAttribute -net net1 -shield_net {vdd vss}

                setAttribute -net net2 -shield_net vss

                globalDetailRoute

              * The following commands show how to shield two nets (do not shield more than  one  net  with  the
                same command):

                setAttribute -net net1 -shield_net abc_gnd

                setAttribute -net net2 -shield_net abc_gnd
