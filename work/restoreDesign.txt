Name
       restoreDesign  -  Restores a saved database created by saveDesign in a previous session. It auto-detects the
       database type and loads it

Syntax
       restoreDesign [-help] [-noTiming] [{{<session> <design>} | {-cellview <lib cell  view>}}  [-mmmcFile  <file-
       Name>]  [-lef_files  <list_of_files>]]  [-setup_views  <setup_views> -hold_views <hold_views>] [-readGlobals
       <variable>] [-leakage_view <analysis_view> -dynamic_view <analysis_view>] [-noTimingGraph]

Description
       Restores a saved database created by saveDesign in a previous session. It auto-detects the database type and
       loads it. An OpenAccess DB format is restored with -cellview {<lib> <cell> <view>} while a native Innovus DB
       format is read using <<session>> <design> for the DB directory name.

       saveDesign optionally includes various types of data, including timing-graph data, RC extraction  data.  So,
       the state of the DB after restoreDesign depends on what was saved, and you may need to repeat RC extraction,
       timing analysis, etc. if that data was not saved.

       If a design is saved with the newer Innovus version and you try to load the design in an older Innovus  ver-
       sion,  the tool will give an error and stop. The "older Innovus version" refers to the main version, such as
       19.1 and 20.1.  The second number after decimal does not make any difference. For example, if  a  design  is
       saved in 20.12 and loaded in 20.11, it will not give any error and will work properly.

       For  OpenAccess usage, simple digital-only designs generally go back and forth with no special handling. But
       some types of Virtuoso custom data cannot be represented directly in the Innovus DB and are  stored  on  the
       side by restoreDesign and geometrically equivalent data is visible in Innovus. That data is then restored by
       saveDesign when you write back to OA using the correct OA settings.

       There are different types of OA methodologies and flows supported that are controlled by setOaxMode. You can
       also   look   at   the   Mixed   Signal  Interoperability  Guide  for  more  details  on  their  effects  on
       saveDesign/restoreDesign.

       Note:

              * Innovus does not support loading another DB while a design is already in memory.

              *

                You should not modify the contents of a saved DB (*.enc.dat or *.db) at any time. If  the  contents
                of  the  saved DB are modified, restoring such modified DB might cause problems later or lead to DB
                corruption or crashes.


Parameters
       -help  Prints a brief description that includes the type and  default  information  for  each  restoreDesign
              parameter.

              For a detailed description of the command and all of its parameters, use the man command:

              man restoreDesign

       -cellview <lib cell view>
              Specifies the library name, cell name, and view name for reading an OpenAccess DB design.

       <design>
              Specifies the top cell of the design saved in the <session> directory.

       -dynamic_view <analysis_view>
              Specifies the analysis view for the dynamic power analysis.

       -hold_views <hold_views>
              Specifies the hold views for loading, rather than the hold views active during saveDesign.


       -leakage_view <analysis_view>
              Specifies the analysis view for leakage power analysis.

       -lef_files <list_of_files>
              Specifies  the  LEF  files  name for loading. Use this option if you want to replace the existing LEF
              files in the design with new LEF files instead.

              * This option is intended to allow upgrading to new versions of LEF files that  are  compatible  with
                the old versions. The list of all LEF files used by this design must be given.

              * If  any  pin  locations or cell boundaries or OBS shapes are changed for used cells, new DRC viola-
                tions may occur.

              * If pins are added or removed from used cells, or used cells are removed,  fatal  errors  may  occur
                when loading the netlist.

              * If  the  removed pins and cells are unused in the design, warnings or errors may still occur if any
                library-specific data was stored for those cells or pins  during  the  design  flow  (for  example,
                dont_touch data)


              Example

              Existing LEFs used by saveDesign: tech.lef, A.lef

              You can change A.lef to A_v2.lef as given below:

              restoreDesign place.enc.dat top -lef_files {tech.lef A_v2.lef}

       -noTimingGraph
              Skips reading the timing graph even if it was saved to the disk by saveDesign.


       -mmmcFile
              Specifies the path name to a Multi-Mode/Multi-Corner (MMMC) configuration file (for example, the same
              file format used by init_mmmc_file) to replace the MMMC file saved by saveDesign (and all the  corre-
              sponding .lib files, .sdc files, etc. referenced by the MMMC file).

              If  a  new MMMC file is specified using -mmmcFile, the RC data saved by the previous session may mis-
              match with the new MMMC file and cause issues. If restoreDesign -mmmcFile is specified,  by  default,
              the tool will not load the RC data. You need to re-extract RC after the design is loaded.

              Note:  CCOpt  configuration  will  not  be restored with -mmmcFile specified. You need to re-run cre-
              ate_ccopt_clock_tree_spec after restoreDesign to create a new CCOpt  configuration  against  the  new
              MMMC configuration.


       -noTiming
              Skips reading the MMMC file, timing libraries, and timing constraints.

              Note:  Most designs that use LEF rely on the .lib information to define the bus order for MACROs that
              have bus bit terminals. Therefore, using the -noTiming option can result in the connectivity  to  bus
              ports  of leaf level instances being reversed. When .lib information is not available, the default is
              for bus ports to be treated as descending (for example, [7:0]). When using Verilog modules or OpenAc-
              cess abstract views to define the bus order, the connectivity will still be correct even when -noTim-
              ing is specified.

              Timing libraries cannot be loaded in the same session after a design  is  read  using  the  -noTiming
              option.  You  must use restoreDesign without the -noTiming option in a new session to load the design
              with timing libraries and constraints.

              If you save a design after restoreDesign -noTiming, it will not save timing  information  unless  you
              use saveDesign -addtiming.

       -readGlobals <variable>
              Specifies  the  UDM variables to be honored when restoring the design. You need to provide a tcl file
              with the pre-defined UDM variable names to be honored.


       <session>
              Specifies the directory from which to load the DB files. If the <<session>> name ends with .tar.gz it
              is  treated  as  a gzipped tar file (see saveDesign -tgz option) that is extracted into the directory
              first.  So, restoreDesign test.enc.dat.tar.gz will create a directory named  test  with  all  the  DB
              files inside it.


       -setup_views <setup_views>
              Specifies the setup views for loading. Rather than the setup views active during saveDesign.


Examples
              * The following command loads the saved design files from the test.enc.dat directory:

                restoreDesign test.enc.dat top

              * For physical-only editing, you can do this to speedup restoreDesign/saveDesign by ignoring the tim-
                ing during restoreDesign, and adding it back during saveDesign.

                restoreDesign test1.enc.dat top -noTiming

                <physical-only editing>

                saveDesign test2.enc.dat -addtiming

                Then in a new session

                restoreDesign test2.enc.dat top     #has timing from test1.enc.dat

                If the logical netlist was modified during editing of test1.enc.dat, then reading test2.enc.dat may
                have unpredictable timing results.


              * The  following command reads the "designLib top placed" OpenAccess cellview but replaces the exist-
                ing MMMC settings in the design with the settings in new_mmmc.tcl:

                restoreDesign -cellview "designLib top placed" -mmmcFile new_mmmc.tcl

              * The following command reads the placed.enc.dat design but replaces the saved MMMC settings  in  the
                design with the settings in new_mmmc.tcl:

                restoreDesign placed.enc.dat -mmmcFile new_mmmc.tcl

                Then create a new CCOpt configuration:

                create_ccopt_clock_tree_spec
