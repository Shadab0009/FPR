Description
       Creates  cell  placement  blockages  that can be placed. A placement blockage is a floorplan object
       used to block standard cell placements. Use this command after importing the design.


Parameters
       -allMacro
              For each macro creates a placement blockage covering that macro.

              Data_type: bool, optional

       -allPartition
              For each partition creates a placement blockage covering that partition.

              Data_type: bool, optional

       -box {<x1 y1 x2 y2>}
              Specifies the coordinates of the blockage area.

              * x1: Specifies the lower left x coordinate of the obstruction area.

              * y1: Specifies the lower left y coordinate of the obstruction area.

              * x2: Specifies the upper right x coordinate of the obstruction area.

              * y2: Specifies the upper right y coordinate of the obstruction area.


              Note: You can enclose the coordinate values (x1...y2) in double-quotes, curly-braces, [ list
              ... ], or just separate them with spaces.

              Data_type: box optional


       -boxList {{<x1 y1> <x2 y2>} ...}
              Specifies the coordinates of a list of blockage areas.

              Data_type: box_list, optional

       -cover By  default  the parameters (-outerRingByEdge and -outerRingBySide) used to create placement
              blockages around the outside of the object, create toroidal placement blockages. The  -cover
              parameter  combined  with these parameters creates a solid placement blockage, otherwise the
              -cover parameter does nothing.

              Data_type: bool, optional


       -density <value>
              Specifies the maximum density allowed for partial or soft blockages. The value is  in  steps
              of  5 between 5 and 100, with units of percent. For example, a partial placement value of 75
              means that up to 75 percent placement density is allowed in the area.

              Note: The -density and -excludeFlops parameters can only be used  in  combination  with  the
              -type partial or -type soft parameter.

              Minimum: 5

              Maximum: 100

              Data_type: inst, optional

       -excludeFlops
              Specifies that flops and latches will not be placed in the blockage during global placement.

              Note:  The  -density  and  -excludeFlops parameters can only be used in combination with the
              -type partial or -type soft parameter.

              Data_type: bool, optional

       -outerRingByEdge {<edge1 edge2 edge3 ...>}
              Creates  a  hollow ring of placement blockage around the outside of the object(s) specified.
              edgeN is the width in microns of the placement blockage along the Nth  edge.  edge1  is  the
              vertical  edge starting at the left corner of the leftmost edge with the lowest y coordinate

                parameter.

              * There must be an edgeN specified for every edge of the object(s).

              * By default, a toroid of blockage is created around the specified object(s). Use the -cover
                parameter to create a solid blockage over the objects with the specified  additional  halo
                of blockage.

              * Enclose the edgeNs in double-quotes, curly braces, or [ list ... ].


              Data_type: string, optional

              * The -inst, -hinst, or -allPartition parameters must be specified with this parameter.

              * The -outerRingBySide parameter can be used with rectilinear objects.

              * By default, a toroid of blockage is created around the specified object(s). Use the -cover
                parameter to create a solid blockage over the objects with the specified  additional  halo
                of blockage.

              * Enclose the bottom...left in double-quotes, curly braces, or [ list ... ].

       -snapToSite
              Snaps the newly created placement blockage to a row site.

              Data_type: bool, optional


       -type {hard | soft | partial | macroOnly}
              Specifies the type of blockage to be created.

              * hard:  Neither  standard  cell instances nor macros may be placed in the blockage. This is
                the default.

              * soft: Only buffers, inverters, isolation cells, clock gates, tie cells and level  shifters
                are allowed to be placed inside the soft blockages. All other cells are placed outside the
                soft placement blockage. You can optionally specify cells and instances that  are  allowed
                or  forbidden  to be placed inside soft blockages by using the specifySelectiveBlkgGate or
                unspecifySelectiveBlkgGate commands.

              * partial: In conjunction with the  -density  parameter  alone  or  with  the  -density  and
                -excludeFlops parameters together, creates a placement blockage that has a maximum density
                as specified (and sometimes excludes flops and latches too).

              * macro_only: Enables the proto_design command to keep macros out of the placement blockage;
                however,  it  enables  standard  cells  to  be  placed inside the box as if no blockage is
                present. Macro-Only blockage is represented as "0" percent partial blockage  in  floorplan
                file, DEF file, and in Innovus DB.


              Default: hard

              Note:  Alternatively,  you  can  create different types of placement blockages using the Set
              Placement Blockage Options form or after creating the placement blockage,  you  can  double-
              click  on the object in the design display area to open the Attribute Editor and select from
              four blockage types.

              Data_type: enum, optional
